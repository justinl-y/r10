The purpose of this project was to create, using react-native, mobile apps for the iOS and Android platforms.  The app built modelled
 an event scheduling app for a fictitious tech conference.

## Technologies Used

 - React & React Native
 - JavaScript
 - Redux
 - Realm
 - Ex-navigator
 - Development tools (Git, babel, es-lint, npm / yarn)

## Personal Learnings

 This project gave me experience in building mobile apps for the iOS and Android platforms using JavaScript with React-Native.  The app used a series of
  react-native components to construct the various scenes of the app.  Database connections were being made via REST end-points for remote database operations 
  and a local-device Realm database for local operations.  Redux was integrated into the react-native architecture for state management.
